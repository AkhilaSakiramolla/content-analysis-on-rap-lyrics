# Content Analysis On Rap Lyrics

Rap is one of the most prominent music genres of the late twentieth and early twenty-first 
centuries. The genre has attracted the youngest demographic group in the US and has been 
regarded as a favorite by most young Americans aged 16 to 24, regardless of socioeconomic status 
and ethnicity. It is significant because US youth listen to music almost 40 hours a week and 
listening time has increased 36.6% since 2015. Furthermore, rappers have been found to serve 
as role models for young audiences, influencing their identity development. 

But it has also been at the center of concern for the potential harm caused by violent media on 
young people's social behavior. There is a problem with lyrical content in rap music and music in 
general in recent years, and youth are being influenced by this music. For years, music has 
constantly mentioned drugs, violence, sex, and money, but the internet and new music platforms 
have given artists the opportunity to reach a global audience in seconds. In addition to the new 
wave of rapping about pill addiction, about killing and beating people, and the fact that anyone 
can record a song nowadays, this has created a generation of drug-addicted, violent youth.

The aim of this study is to investigate the changing images of violence and substance abuse in rap 
music lyrics and to check whether these references have increased over time
